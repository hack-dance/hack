# Hack desktop app (preview)

Unsupported preview of a minimal native window for Hack (HACK-2214): every
project, its state and services, and Start / Stop / Restart / Open. It is a view
over the `hack` CLI and the `hackd` socket; it keeps no state beyond window
layout, holds no credentials and runs `hack` as you for every action. Not part
of the release or onboarding yet.

| Crate | What |
|---|---|
| `core` (`hack-desktop-core`) | Models, CLI runner with timeouts, read-only hackd client, project state, list/detail view models, fixtures. No GUI dependency. |
| `app` (`hack-desktop`) | The window, built with [gpui-kit](https://gpui-kit.com/) `=0.9.1`. |

This is its own Cargo workspace with its own lockfile and target directory; it
does not touch `packages/runtime-core`.

## Build and run

Rust **1.98.1**, pinned for this workspace only by `rust-toolchain.toml` (rustup)
and `mise.toml` (mise); the repo root keeps its own pin. macOS needs at least
1.98 (`gpui-pre-macos` uses `Option::map_or_default`). macOS 15+, or Linux with
Wayland or X11 and Vulkan. Linux build packages: `clang libfontconfig-dev
libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libssl-dev libzstd-dev
libvulkan-dev`.

```sh
cd apps/desktop
cargo test -p hack-desktop-core          # no daemon, Docker or Hack home needed
cargo run -p hack-desktop                # live: hackd, else `hack projects --json`
cargo run -p hack-desktop -- --list-fixtures
cargo run -p hack-desktop -- --fixtures failed-start --theme dark
```

## Check the live data path without a window

```sh
cargo run -p hack-desktop-core --bin hack-desktop-state            # all projects
cargo run -p hack-desktop-core --bin hack-desktop-state -- --project <name>
```

`hack-desktop-state` reads exactly what the window reads: hackd when its version
matches the CLI, otherwise `hack projects --json`, plus native `hack ps` for
native projects. It applies that to the same view model and prints the list and
each project's detail as JSON. It runs no action, opens no window and writes
nothing.

Every designed state has a fixture (`loading`, `empty`, `daemon-down`, `many-projects`,
`daemon-mismatch`, `engine-down`, `error`, `cli-missing`, `stopped`, `starting`,
`running`, `degraded`, `stopping`, `failed-start`, `needs-attention`).

## Screenshots without a display

```sh
cargo run -p hack-desktop --features screenshots -- --screenshots /tmp/shots
```

This renders every fixture in light and dark to PNG with GPUI's offscreen
renderer (WGPU on Linux, Metal on macOS). It opens no window. Current renders
(all 15 fixtures, row by row: loading, empty, daemon-down / daemon-mismatch,
engine-down, error / cli-missing, many-projects, stopped / starting, running,
degraded / stopping, failed-start, needs-attention):
[light](screenshots/fixtures-light.png), [dark](screenshots/fixtures-dark.png).

## Doctor

The sidebar Doctor row reads `hack doctor --json` once outside all projects and
once per registered checkout. Machine checks are deduplicated by check id;
project findings link from the project header. Unknown statuses, failed reads
and projects not reached within the 90-second refresh budget remain unchecked.
Checks refresh on opening the pane and every ten minutes while it is visible.

Cards group findings by area and offer one copied command or documentation link.
Project commands include the checkout path. The app never runs a Doctor fix:
one-click fixes remain blocked on the CLI's explicit safe-fix metadata (R7a/R7b).
The probes do not use `hack global status`, which can start Docker.

## What v0 does not do yet

Logs, Env and Activity tabs, CPU and memory, onboarding, always-on,
daemon actions and upgrades come in later units. The design and the CLI/daemon
requests they need are in `DESIGN.md` (PR #800).
